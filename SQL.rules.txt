mySQL understanding rules to help with my logic
1. It always involves making new tables from the original data as Pete says filtering
2. know my clauses where, and, or, group by
3. know logical operators (like,in,on,between)
4. know comparison operators ( i am a mathematician duh)
5. aggregate
6. filter aggregates to get desired results.

GROUP RULEs for me
0. An attribute that cannot be grouped does NOT go into the group by clause (NEVER DOES)
1. Group what can be grouped and the attribute aggregated does not need to be in the group by clause

my proudest SQL moment 
-- new master task, count the number of page_scrolls by user in the data
with sc as (
select user_id, timestamp::date, action, count(*) as freq from facebook_web_log
where action =  'scroll_down'
or action = 'scroll_up'
group by (user_id, timestamp::date, action)
)

select user_id, sum(freq) as scroll_freq from sc
group by user_id
order by 1
